In November 2025, the livestreaming scene in China was electrified by anime-style RPGs, showcasing a remarkable surge in viewership that highlights the genre's enduring appeal. According to Niko Partners' China Games & Livestreaming Tracker, major version updates and anniversary events were pivotal in driving this interest, with standout titles like Kuro Games Wuthering Waves and miHoYos Zenless Zone Zero leading the charge.

Wuthering Waves achieved an impressive 36.5 million viewers, marking a 103% month-over-month increase, while Zenless Zone Zero attracted 30.9 million viewers, up 84% from the previous month. Both games leveraged strategic livestream events to unveil new content, demonstrating how critical platforms like Bilibili have become for engaging a younger audience passionate about ACGN culture.

The phenomenal rise of Yostars Stella Sora, which skyrocketed to 9 million viewers after its first major content update, further underscores the potential for new titles to capture audience attention in this vibrant ecosystem. As the gaming landscape continues to evolve, one has to wonder: what will be the next big trend in livestreaming that keeps viewers coming back for more?
