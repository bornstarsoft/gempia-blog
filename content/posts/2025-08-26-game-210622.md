Former Capcom director Hideaki Itsuno is making waves in the gaming industry with the launch of his new studio in Osaka, which aims to create original AAA titles. This bold move comes after over 30 years at Capcom, where Itsuno directed iconic games like Devil May Cry and Dragons Dogma. By assembling a team of veterans from the beloved franchises, he is setting the stage for a fresh approach to game development, focusing on trust and collaboration among his team.

Itsuno's commitment to building original IPs from scratch is particularly noteworthy, as he aims to break away from the cycle of sequels that often dominates the industry. With key hires like narrative designer Toshihiro Nakagawa and artist Daigo Ikeno, the new studio is poised to leverage decades of experience while fostering innovation. Itsuno's vision reflects a growing trend in the gaming world, where creators seek to push boundaries and explore new narratives.

As the gaming landscape evolves, the success of Itsuno's new venture could inspire other developers to take similar risks. Will we see a resurgence of original titles that redefine genres, or will the allure of established franchises continue to dominate? Only time will tell.
