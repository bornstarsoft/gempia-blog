Square Enix's recent comparison video showcasing Final Fantasy 7 Remake Intergrade across the Switch 2, PS5, Xbox Series X, and PC highlights a remarkable achievement in gaming technology. Despite the Switch 2's less powerful hardware, the game manages to deliver impressive visual quality that rivals its more robust counterparts. This is particularly noteworthy as it demonstrates that with the right optimizations, a handheld console can still provide a visually engaging experience.

The video reveals subtle differences in texture quality, but overall, players may find it challenging to discern which version is which. The emphasis on maintaining high-quality lighting, as noted by game director Naoki Hamaguchi, plays a crucial role in preserving the game's aesthetic appeal. By focusing on optimizing other elements like fog and post-processing effects, the Switch 2 version runs smoothly at a stable 30 frames per second, ensuring that players enjoy a visually rich experience without significant compromises.

As we look ahead to the game's release on January 22, it raises an intriguing question: Could this level of optimization set a new standard for future ports on less powerful hardware? The gaming community is certainly eager to find out.
