Sony has recently patented an innovative technology that could revolutionize the gaming experience for PlayStation users. The concept, known as the 'Ghost Player,' allows players to summon an AI-generated version of their character to assist them when they encounter challenging sections of a game. This could mean the difference between frustration and progress, as the AI can either demonstrate the solution or complete the task entirely.

This technology builds upon existing systems like the PS5 Game Help, which provides players with guidance through images and videos. However, the Ghost Player takes it a step further by utilizing AI trained on actual gameplay footage, ensuring a more dynamic and personalized assistance experience. While the patent has been filed, it's important to note that there are no confirmed plans for its implementation in future hardware.

As AI-powered gaming assistants become more prevalent, we can't help but wonder: will this technology redefine how we interact with games, or will it simply be another feature that fades into the background? The future of gaming assistance is certainly an exciting prospect to consider.
