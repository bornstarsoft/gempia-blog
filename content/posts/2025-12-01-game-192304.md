After over 20 years of writing about games, I am thrilled to announce that I have finally achieved a lifelong dream: being credited in a video game! My contributions to AHRO, an innovative indie game by OEH Interactive, have been recognized in the end-game credits, marking a significant milestone in my career. This unique title, which emphasizes deep lore and exploration over combat, has just launched its free v2.0 version on platforms like Steam, Switch, Linux, and Atari VCS.

Being part of the QA and promotional efforts for AHRO has been an incredibly rewarding experience. The games focus on storytelling and world-building resonates deeply with my passion for gaming. Seeing my name listed not once, but twice in the credits is a moment I will cherish forever. Its a reminder that dreams can come true, even in unexpected ways.

As I reflect on this achievement, I cant help but wonder what the future holds for indie games and how they will continue to innovate in the gaming landscape. Have you ever had a dream come true in your career?
