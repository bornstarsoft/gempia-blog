Indie developer Pixel Maniacs is making waves with their upcoming title, **ChromaGun 2: Dye Hard**, boldly claiming, "Valve never made a Portal 2 sequel. So we did." This audacious statement sets the stage for a game that aims to capture the essence of beloved puzzle classics while carving out its unique identity. With a free demo available on Steam, players can get a taste of this intriguing FPS puzzle game that revolves around color manipulation.

While the game's setting evokes memories of the iconic Aperture Science testing chambers, the gameplay diverges significantly from the Portal series. Instead of utilizing portals, players will engage in puzzle-solving reminiscent of titles like **Qube** and **Qube 2**, focusing on colored blocks and creative solutions. This shift in mechanics could attract a new audience while satisfying fans of the original ChromaGun, which received 'Mostly Positive' reviews upon its release in 2016.

As we look forward to ChromaGun 2's full release, it's exciting to see indie developers pushing boundaries and challenging the status quo in the gaming industry. Will this sequel live up to the legacy of its predecessors, or will it forge a new path for puzzle games? Only time will tell.
