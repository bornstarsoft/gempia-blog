NINES has officially unveiled their upcoming puzzle game, Pipeworks Puzzle, and it promises to deliver a fresh take on the classic tile sliding puzzle genre. Set in a charming construction site, players will step into the shoes of a plumber tasked with arranging disordered pipe pieces to create a seamless flow, all while enjoying adorable visuals and soothing soundtracks. This unique blend of engaging gameplay and aesthetic appeal is sure to captivate puzzle enthusiasts and casual gamers alike.

In Pipeworks Puzzle, players will navigate a grid-based arena, moving pipe pieces in cardinal directions to match the provided blueprint. A delightful support character, affectionately named ‘Boss’, will guide players from novice to master plumber, adding an extra layer of charm to the experience. Designed by the talented PokuriMio, Boss is set to become a fan favorite, enhancing the game's narrative and providing helpful tips along the way.

For those eager to get in on the action, Pipeworks Puzzle is now available for wishlisting on Steam. By adding it to your wishlist, you can unlock exciting new features like an endless mode, speedrun challenges, and even multiplayer battles with friends. Plus, a demo is on the horizon, so be sure to follow the game on Steam to stay updated on its release.

As we await the launch later this year, it’s exciting to think about how Pipeworks Puzzle will innovate the puzzle genre. Will it become the next must-have title for puzzle lovers? Only time will tell!
