In an exciting reveal during the latest Nintendo Partner Direct, Shapefarm and Kepler Interactive showcased fresh gameplay for "Orbitals," a co-op adventure set to launch exclusively on the Nintendo Switch 2 this summer. Players will embark on an exhilarating journey with the dynamic duo, Maki and Omura, as they navigate through treacherous asteroid fields and perilous caverns, all while battling against a menacing cosmic storm threatening their home.

What sets "Orbitals" apart is its engaging gameplay mechanics, where players can utilize a variety of innovative tools like the Scrap Hook, Liquid Launcher, and Beam Cannon.
