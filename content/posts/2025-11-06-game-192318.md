In a surprising turn of events, NetEase Games has announced the closure of Bad Brain Game Studios, a Montreal-based developer that was only established in 2023. The studio, led by Sean Crooks, will officially shut its doors on November 17, leaving behind an intriguing project known as The Midnight Riders, which was teased in a recently released sizzle reel showcasing an 80s-themed action-adventure game.

Despite the closure, there is a silver lining for potential partners and publishers. NetEase Games has indicated that both the game and its intellectual property are available for acquisition or partnership, signaling a willingness to continue the development of The Midnight Riders. This opens up possibilities for other developers who might see the potential in this nostalgic title.

As the gaming industry continues to evolve, the fate of The Midnight Riders raises questions about the sustainability of new studios and the importance of strategic partnerships. Will another developer step in to revive this promising project?
