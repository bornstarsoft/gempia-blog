As we approach the Fourth of July, a time synonymous with fireworks and parades, it’s fascinating to consider how technology has transformed our traditional celebrations. From live-streaming fireworks displays to interactive apps that guide us to the best viewing spots, technology enhances our patriotic experiences in ways we might not even realize.

Local news articles and social media keep us informed about events, while puzzle games like crosswords add a fun twist to our celebrations, challenging our minds as we celebrate our nation's history.

As we enjoy the festivities, let’s reflect on how technology continues to shape our traditions. How do you think tech will change the way we celebrate holidays in the future?
