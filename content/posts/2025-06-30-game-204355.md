Nintendo has officially announced the release of Drag x Drive for the Nintendo Switch 2, set to launch on August 14, 2025, at a price of $30 AUD. This innovative game allows players to use Joy-Con controllers in mouse mode, enabling them to steer and drive a wheelchair in an engaging 3-on-3 basketball format. The unique control scheme promises to enhance the gaming experience, making it more interactive and accessible.

Having had the chance to play Drag x Drive at the Nintendo Switch 2 Experience in Melbourne, I was pleasantly surprised by how intuitive the mouse controls felt. The game proved to be much more thrilling in practice than it appeared in its initial reveal video. This could mark a significant step forward in how we think about gaming controls and inclusivity in sports games.

As we approach the release date, excitement is building. Will Drag x Drive redefine how we engage with sports games on consoles? Let me know your thoughts in the comments!
