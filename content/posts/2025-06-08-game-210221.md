At the Summer Games Fest 2025, a standout title emerged that promises to redefine the extraction genre: **Mistfall Hunter**. This dark fantasy RPG combines traditional role-playing elements with the high-stakes mechanics of extraction gameplay, a unique blend that sets it apart from the typical shooter-centric offerings in this space. As the genre gains traction, Mistfall Hunter's innovative approach could attract both RPG enthusiasts and extraction game fans alike.

Players will embark on quests to collect valuable resources while engaging in intense battles against both other players and NPCs on a shrinking map. The extraction process hinges on defeating a creature called the Returner Woodling, which drops a crucial item known as the "Soul of Return." However, this extraction isn't subtle; it triggers a loud alarm that alerts nearby players, adding a thrilling layer of tension as you attempt to escape with your loot.

With options for solo play or team-based trios, Mistfall Hunter caters to various play styles, allowing players to choose from six distinct classes, each with unique abilities. This flexibility, combined with the promise of additional classes post-launch, ensures that players will have plenty of opportunities to find their perfect playstyle. As we look forward to its release later this year, Mistfall Hunter could very well become a favorite for those seeking a fresh experience in the extraction genre. Will you be ready to face the challenge?
