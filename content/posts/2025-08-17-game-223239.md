In a surprising turn of events, the Standard Edition of Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 will reportedly not cost $80 in the US, as confirmed by the reliable insider billbil-kun. This pricing decision comes amidst a competitive gaming landscape, particularly with the upcoming Battlefield 6, which is set to launch at the same $69.99 price point. By keeping the price lower, Microsoft aims to attract more players and maintain a competitive edge.

The Standard Edition is expected to retail for $69.99 in the US and 79.99 in Europe, while the Vault Edition, which includes additional content, will be priced at $99.99. This strategic pricing could be a calculated move to prevent potential buyers from gravitating towards Battlefield 6, which has already demonstrated impressive engagement numbers during its Open Beta.

As the gaming community eagerly anticipates the release on November 14, the question remains: will this pricing strategy effectively sway players towards Black Ops 7, or will Battlefield 6 still dominate the market? Only time will tell as we approach the holiday gaming season.
