Capcom has officially put to rest the speculation surrounding its upcoming game, Pragmata, confirming that it is not a secret revival of the beloved Mega Man franchise. This revelation comes after fans noted the striking similarities between Pragmata's robotic sidekick, Diana, and the iconic Mega Man character, as well as thematic elements that hinted at a crossover. However, producer Naoto Oyama has assured fans that Pragmata is a completely original title, distinct from any existing Capcom IP.

Despite the disappointment for some Mega Man enthusiasts, Capcom has expressed its ongoing commitment to the franchise. With the last major release being Mega Man 11 in 2018, fans have been eagerly awaiting news of a new installment. Pragmata, first announced in June 2020, has faced multiple delays and is now set to launch in 2026, leaving many curious about what Capcom has in store.

As we look forward to Pragmata's release, its exciting to see Capcom exploring new ideas while still honoring its legacy franchises. Will this new IP capture the hearts of gamers like Mega Man did? Only time will tell.
