As the launch date for Battlefield 6 approaches, one of the most intriguing revelations from the developers is their commitment to a console-first experience. Technical Director Christian Buhl emphasized that the game was designed with console players in mind from the very beginning, marking a significant shift from the franchise's traditional PC-centric development. This approach not only enhances the gameplay for console users but also optimizes performance across all platforms, including PC.

Senior Console Combat Designer Matthew Nickerson humorously coined the term 'Secretly Console First' to describe this philosophy, highlighting the developers' dedication to crafting a top-tier console experience. Players can also look forward to the option to disable crossplay with PC, ensuring a more balanced competitive environment among console gamers. The matchmaking system will prioritize console players, further enhancing the experience.

With the ongoing testing of the Battle Royale mode and these exciting features, Battlefield 6 is shaping up to be a landmark title for both console and PC gamers. Will this new direction redefine the franchise and set a new standard for future games? Let's wait and see!
