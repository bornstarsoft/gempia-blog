BitSummit, Japan's premier indie game expo, is set to return this July, showcasing an impressive lineup of 120 indie games from both Japan and around the globe. This yearâ€™s event will take place at the Miyako Messe in Kyoto from July 19 to July 21, marking the 13th iteration of this beloved festival. The theme, "Summer of Yokai," pays homage to Japan's rich folklore, promising an exciting experience for attendees and developers alike.

Founded in 2012 by the Japan Independent Games Aggregate (JIGA), BitSummit has grown from a modest gathering of 200 attendees to a vibrant community event that attracted over 38,000 visitors last year. The event not only highlights the creativity and innovation within the indie gaming scene but also serves as a platform for developers to connect with fans and industry professionals. John Davis, co-founder of JIGA, expressed excitement over the diverse submissions received this year, emphasizing the festival's role in celebrating indie creativity and bold ideas.

As the event approaches, tickets are now available for purchase, with the first day dedicated to industry professionals and the weekend open to the general public. This year, VGC will continue its role as the western media partner, providing comprehensive coverage of the event. With the indie gaming landscape constantly evolving, BitSummit remains a crucial event for anyone interested in the future of gaming. Will you be joining the celebration of creativity and innovation in Kyoto this summer?
