In a daring move that echoes the legacy of Valve's iconic Portal series, indie developer Pixel Maniacs has announced their upcoming title, *ChromaGun 2: Dye Hard*. With the bold claim that "Valve never made a Portal 2 sequel. So we did," they are stepping into a space that many gamers hold dear. The original *Portal* and its sequel have set a high bar for puzzle games, and Pixel Maniacs is determined to carve out its own niche in this beloved genre.

While *ChromaGun 2* shares a colorful aesthetic reminiscent of *Portal*, the gameplay mechanics draw more parallels to titles like *Qube* and *Qube 2*. Players will utilize a unique gun to manipulate colors and solve puzzles, but the absence of portals marks a significant departure from the classic formula. This fresh take on puzzle-solving promises to engage players in new ways, offering a blend of creativity and challenge that could redefine expectations for indie puzzle games.

The original *ChromaGun*, released in 2016, received 'Mostly Positive' reviews, setting a solid foundation for its sequel. With a free demo available on Steam, players can get a taste of what Pixel Maniacs has in store. As we look ahead to the game's release, one can't help but wonder: will *ChromaGun 2* successfully capture the magic of its predecessors while forging its own identity in the gaming landscape?
