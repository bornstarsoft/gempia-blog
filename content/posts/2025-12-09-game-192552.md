In a recent discussion at the G-Star game developer convention, Dragon Quest creator Yuji Horii expressed his enthusiasm for integrating AI chatbots into future games. He envisions a gaming experience where players can solve mysteries alongside a virtual partner powered by AI, enhancing the interactive narrative and gameplay.

Horii highlighted the potential of AI, particularly referencing ChatGPT, as a tool that can engage players in logical and meaningful conversations. He imagines scenarios where players could interrogate AI characters or collaborate with them to uncover clues, making the gaming experience not just about gameplay but also about dynamic storytelling.

As the gaming landscape continues to evolve, the incorporation of AI could redefine how we interact with virtual worlds. Will we soon see games where our AI companions are as integral to the story as the characters themselves?
