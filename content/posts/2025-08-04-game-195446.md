Microsoft is reportedly eyeing a 2026 release for Starfield on PlayStation 5, a significant shift for the sci-fi RPG that has so far been exclusive to Xbox Series X/S and PC. This news comes on the heels of disappointing sales for its first expansion, Shattered Space, which launched to mixed reviews in September 2024. The anticipated PS5 version is said to be timed with the release of the game's second expansion, potentially titled 'Starborn', alongside various quality of life updates.

As Microsoft continues to reshape its gaming strategy, the move to bring Starfield to PS5 aligns with Phil Spencer's vision of inclusivity across platforms. This approach marks a departure from traditional exclusivity, as Microsoft aims to reach a broader audience. With the gaming landscape evolving, it raises questions about the future of exclusive titles and how they might impact player engagement.

As we look forward to 2026, the gaming community is left pondering: will Starfield's PS5 release reignite interest in the franchise, or will it struggle to capture the attention of a new audience? Only time will tell.
