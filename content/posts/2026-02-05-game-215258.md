In a fascinating revelation, Pokmon illustrator Yusuke Ohmura has shared that the bizarre designs of the Ultra Beasts were inspired by previously rejected Pokmon concepts. Introduced in Pokmon Sun and Moon, these creatures were intentionally crafted to look as different from traditional Pokmon as possible, representing a unique artistic direction fueled by Ohmura's own experiences with rejection in the design process.

Ohmura explained that the Ultra Beasts are a manifestation of his resentment towards the designs that were turned down by Ken Sugimori, the primary Pokmon character designer. By transforming these rejected ideas into more monstrous forms, Ohmura created characters that not only stand out visually but also carry a deeper narrative of artistic struggle and acceptance.

This insight into the creative process behind the Ultra Beasts invites us to reflect on how rejection can lead to innovation. How many other iconic designs in gaming history have roots in similar experiences? The world of game design is full of untold stories waiting to be discovered.
