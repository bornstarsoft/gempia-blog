Netflix has announced that it will be delisting more than 20 mobile games next month, including popular titles like Hades, Braid: Anniversary Edition, and the entire Monument Valley trilogy. This move raises questions about the future of mobile gaming on the platform and what it means for subscribers who have come to enjoy these exclusive titles.

The majority of the games will be removed on July 14, with some, like Hades, disappearing even sooner on July 1. While Netflix has been expanding its gaming library since 2021, the delisting of these games—most of which are exclusive to the service—signals a significant shift in their mobile gaming strategy. Many of these titles are not available on traditional app stores, leaving fans wondering if they will ever see them again.

As Netflix continues to refine its gaming offerings, it remains to be seen how many of these delisted games will make a return to iOS and Android outside of the Netflix app. With developers like Devolver Digital expressing interest in re-releasing their titles as premium games, the landscape of mobile gaming could change dramatically in the coming months. Will Netflix's gaming ambitions evolve further, or will this be a sign of a more cautious approach moving forward?
