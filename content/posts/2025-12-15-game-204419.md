Long-lost NES puzzle game Xcavator, developed by Chris Oberth in 1991, is making a comeback thanks to a collaboration between iam8bit and the Video Game History Foundation. This fully polished cartridge edition, priced at $100, not only revives a piece of gaming history but also supports vital archival efforts to preserve the legacy of 8-bit games.

The release of Xcavator includes an authentic NES cartridge and a detailed manual that tells the story of the game's troubled past and Oberth's career. This initiative highlights the broader challenges faced in preserving video game history, reminding us of the importance of safeguarding our digital heritage for future generations. As we look forward to the release in 2025, one can't help but wonder: what other hidden gems from the past are waiting to be rediscovered?
