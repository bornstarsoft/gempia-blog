In a significant turn of events, Bad Brain Game Studios, a subsidiary of NetEase, has announced its impending shutdown due to unsuccessful attempts to secure a new partner for its ambitious project, Midnight Riders. This closure, set for November 17th, 2025, serves as a stark reminder of the volatile nature of the gaming industry, where even well-established studios can face dire circumstances despite their best efforts.

Studio head Sean Cooks expressed gratitude towards NetEase for their support during this challenging period, highlighting the team's dedication and creativity in pushing boundaries. However, the reality remains that the gaming landscape is increasingly competitive, and securing partnerships is crucial for survival. As Bad Brain Game Studios prepares to close its doors, the underlying IP of Midnight Riders remains available for acquisition, signaling potential opportunities for other developers.

This closure follows a broader trend within NetEase, which has been scaling back its overseas operations, raising questions about the future of its remaining studios. As we reflect on this situation, it prompts us to consider: what does the future hold for indie developers and smaller studios in an industry dominated by giants? Will we see a resurgence of creativity and innovation, or will the challenges continue to mount?
