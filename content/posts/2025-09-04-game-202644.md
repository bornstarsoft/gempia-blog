The recent launch of MindsEye has left IO Interactive's future in game publishing hanging in the balance. Following a disastrous reception, with a Metacritic score of just 37 on PC and 28 on PS5, the companys CEO, Hakan Abrak, expressed uncertainty about continuing to publish games from other studios under the IOI Partners label. Initially, the partnership with Build a Rocket Boy was seen as a promising venture, but the overwhelming backlash has raised questions about the viability of future collaborations.

In an interview, Abrak acknowledged the challenges faced by Build a Rocket Boy and emphasized their potential to recover. However, he also hinted that while IO Interactive will continue to publish its own games, the future of IOI Partners remains uncertain. This situation underscores the risks involved in game publishing, especially when expectations are high and the execution falls short.

As we look ahead, it will be interesting to see how IO Interactive navigates this setback and whether they will take the plunge into publishing other studios' games again. Can they regain the trust of gamers and find success in future collaborations? Only time will tell.
