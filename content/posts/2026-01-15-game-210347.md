Independent developer sakastudio is set to revolutionize the factory automation genre with their upcoming anime RPG, moorestech, slated for release on PC in August 2026. Unlike traditional automation games that often rely on abstract systems, moorestech introduces a unique gear-based power system that requires players to manage physical components like windmills and gears, making for a more immersive and engaging experience.

The game not only emphasizes automation mechanics but also weaves a compelling narrative around Princess Yori, who seeks to uncover the mystery behind her exile while industrializing the remote planet Arcadia. With a focus on accessibility, moorestech aims to cater to both seasoned automation enthusiasts and newcomers alike, ensuring that everyone can enjoy building intricate production networks.

As the game approaches its launch, the promise of modding support and a dedicated mod editor opens up exciting possibilities for creativity within the community. Will moorestech redefine how we think about factory automation games? Only time will tell, but its certainly one to watch!
