In an exciting development for the indie gaming community, Daniel Knight, the creator of the viral hit Phasmophobia, is launching Kinetic Publishing. This new publishing label aims to support and champion indie developers by providing funding and advisory support, all while maintaining the creative control of the developers. Notably, Kinetic Publishing has taken a strong stance against blockchain, web3, and AI-generated games, focusing solely on nurturing authentic indie creativity.

Knight's vision for Kinetic Publishing is rooted in his own experiences as an indie developer. With a growing team of 40, he believes that now is the perfect time to expand into publishing and help others bring their ideas to life. The publisher is particularly interested in projects that are 12-18 months from completion, emphasizing a commitment to quality and originality in the indie game space.

Asim Tanvir, the newly appointed director of marketing and partnerships, echoes this sentiment, stating that Kinetic is eager to support a diverse range of indie projects, from cozy games to RPGs. This initiative not only highlights the potential for growth within the indie sector but also raises questions about the future of gaming in an era increasingly influenced by technology. Will Kinetic Publishing set a new standard for indie game development?
