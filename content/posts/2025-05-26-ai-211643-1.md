As the NBA playoffs heat up, making strategic choices in your Daily Fantasy Sports (DFS) lineup is crucial. For Game 3 of the Eastern Conference Finals between the New York Knicks and Indiana Pacers, three standout players could significantly impact your DraftKings lineup. Notably, Jalen Brunson emerges as a must-start option, boasting a remarkable 60.75 fantasy points in Game 2 and a staggering 40.2% usage rate in the series. His ability to score 1.2 fantasy points per minute makes him a prime candidate for your captain slot.

On the other hand, Obi Toppin presents an enticing budget-friendly option at $3,600. With an average of 16.1 fantasy points in limited minutes, Toppin's potential to exceed expectations, especially as the Pacers are slight favorites, makes him a valuable addition. Lastly, Aaron Nesmith's impressive postseason performance, highlighted by a 54% shooting rate, positions him as a solid mid-range pick. His defensive skills ensure he sees ample playing time, making him a strategic choice for those looking to differentiate their lineup.

In the ever-evolving landscape of NBA DFS, leveraging insights like these can set your lineup apart from the competition. Which players do you think will shine in this pivotal matchup?
