Microsoft has once again raised the prices of its Xbox consoles in the United States, just five months after a previous increase. This latest adjustment, effective from October 3, reflects the company's response to ongoing changes in the macroeconomic environment. The Xbox Series X and S models will see significant price hikes, making them more expensive than ever before.

The price increases are notable, with the Xbox Series X now priced at $649.99 and the Xbox Series S models seeing increases of $20 on top of earlier hikes. The most staggering change is for the Xbox Series X 2TB Galaxy Black Edition, which has jumped to $799.99. This move places it above the PS5 Pro, which also offers 2TB of storage. While Microsoft assures that prices for controllers and headsets will remain stable, this shift raises questions about the future of console pricing in a competitive market.

As gamers, we must consider how these changes will affect our purchasing decisions and the overall gaming landscape. Will this price increase deter potential buyers, or will the allure of next-gen gaming continue to drive sales?
