The gaming community is buzzing with excitement as Rebel Wolves, a new Polish studio led by former The Witcher 3 director Konrad Tomaszkiewicz, unveils its debut title, The Blood of Dawnwalker. The first gameplay trailer, showcased at the Xbox Games Showcase, reveals a haunting medieval world filled with dark fantasy elements and vampire lore, setting the stage for a gripping single-player RPG experience.

Set to launch in 2026 across PS5, Xbox Series X, Xbox Series S, and PC, The Blood of Dawnwalker promises to immerse players in a narrative where allies may not be as trustworthy as they seem, and the true evil could be lurking in plain sight. Built on the powerful Unreal Engine 5, this game is already generating buzz for its stunning visuals and intricate storytelling, thanks to a team of developers who previously worked on iconic titles like The Witcher 3 and Cyberpunk 2077.

As we await further details and an official release date, fans of dark fantasy RPGs should keep an eye on this promising title. Will The Blood of Dawnwalker redefine the genre, or will it follow in the footsteps of its predecessors? Only time will tell, but one thing is for certain: the anticipation is palpable.
