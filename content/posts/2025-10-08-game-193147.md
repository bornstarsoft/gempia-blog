In an inspiring display of community spirit, a charity quiz has successfully raised over 2 million for Marie Curie over the past 18 years. This annual event, organized by the charity's North East fundraising group, brings together teams from across the region to compete in a fun-filled quiz night, all while supporting a vital cause. Marie Curie provides essential care and support for individuals living with terminal illnesses and their families, making this event not just a competition, but a beacon of hope for many.

The popularity of the quiz has grown significantly, with teams eagerly vying for the title of quiz champions each year. The funds raised have been instrumental in supporting Marie Curie's crucial services, demonstrating how a simple idea can evolve into a powerful force for good. As the organizers gear up for next year's event, they are hopeful of surpassing previous fundraising records, proving that community-driven initiatives can lead to remarkable outcomes.

As we look forward to the next charity quiz, it raises an important question: how can we leverage technology and social media to enhance fundraising efforts and engage even more participants in such noble causes? Let's continue to innovate and inspire!
