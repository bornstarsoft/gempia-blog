The gaming world is buzzing with excitement over the upcoming release of **Pocket Boss**, a unique puzzle game that cleverly intertwines remote work dynamics with corporate data manipulation. Set to launch on Steam, this innovative title was recently showcased during the Day of the Devs event at Summer Game Fest, capturing the attention of gamers and industry enthusiasts alike.

In **Pocket Boss**, players step into the shoes of a remote employee who must navigate the whims of an ever-demanding boss. The gameplay primarily unfolds within a chat window, but it quickly shifts to engaging minigames whenever the boss requires data alterations to boost profits or eliminate competition. With creative challenges like flinging competitors' market shares off-screen and navigating a chaotic stock market, the game promises a fresh take reminiscent of the beloved WarioWare franchise.

Published by Playables, the studio known for its innovative titles like *Time Flies* and the interactive cartoon *KIDS*, Pocket Boss is poised to deliver a fun yet thought-provoking experience. While we await a specific release date, the anticipation surrounding this game reflects a broader trend of incorporating real-world themes into gaming narratives. Will Pocket Boss resonate with players as it tackles the complexities of modern corporate life? Only time will tell.
