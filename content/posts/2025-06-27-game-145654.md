Capcom has unveiled an intriguing glimpse into its upcoming sci-fi title, Pragmata, showcasing a unique blend of puzzle-solving and shooting mechanics. This innovative gameplay, revealed in a recent video, has players engaging in a mini-game to hack robots while simultaneously dodging and shooting them. This dual-action approach promises to deliver a fresh experience that sets Pragmata apart from traditional shooters.

Set in a near-future lunar research station, players will take on the role of Hugh, a combat-ready spaceman, alongside his android companion, Diana, who intriguingly resembles a human child. The game's narrative and mechanics aim to immerse players in a crisis-laden environment, making for a compelling backdrop to the action. Despite multiple delays since its initial announcement in June 2020, anticipation continues to build as Capcom's reputation for delivering polished gaming experiences remains strong.

Having recently experienced a demo of Pragmata, early impressions suggest that the game is not only unique but also highly polished, leaving players eager for more. As we look ahead to its release in 2026, the question remains: can Capcom successfully translate this innovative concept into a fully realized gaming experience that captivates players for hours on end?
