Inotia 4, the beloved mobile RPG from Com2uS, has made its way to Steam, offering players a free-to-play experience that captures the essence of classic JRPGs. With nearly 400 maps and a party-based combat system, this game invites both new and returning players to dive into a rich light-dark fantasy world.

Players will take on the role of Kiyan, an assassin embroiled in a conflict between light and dark, while recruiting mercenaries from a diverse array of classes. The real-time combat, combined with the ability to explore expansive maps filled with quests and crafting opportunities, ensures that theres plenty of content to keep players engaged.
