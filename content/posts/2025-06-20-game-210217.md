In a remarkable move that highlights the evolving landscape of the gaming industry, domestic game companies are rewarding their development teams with the highly sought-after Nintendo Switch 2. Neowiz and ShiftUp, two prominent players in the market, have recently announced substantial incentives for their developers, including cash bonuses and the latest gaming consoles, fostering a culture of performance-based rewards.

Neowiz has taken the lead by offering 10 million won in launch incentives per developer, alongside two weeks of reward leave, following the successful global launch of their action RPG "P's False." This initiative not only recognizes the hard work of the developers but also serves as a motivational tool to enhance creativity and productivity within the team. Similarly, ShiftUp has gifted the Nintendo Switch 2 to all 300 of its employees in celebration of their game "Stella Blade," which has achieved impressive sales milestones since its release.

These rewards are more than just material gifts; they reflect a strategic approach to talent retention and motivation in an industry characterized by rapid change and fierce competition. As companies like Neowiz and ShiftUp continue to innovate and engage their teams, one must wonder: will this trend of rewarding developers with high-end gaming consoles become the new standard in the gaming industry?
