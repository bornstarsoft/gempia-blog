After two decades of anticipation, the Metal Slug development team’s final project, **Navinosuke: The Yo-Kai Buster**, is set to make its debut on the Nintendo Switch in 2026. Originally developed for the Game Boy Advance but ultimately shelved, this “phantom RPG” has finally been resurrected by Kohachi Studio, a team comprising veterans from the Metal Slug and R-Type franchises. The game's director, Shinano Ishiguro, expressed his excitement about lifting the veil on a project that was completed but never released.

Navinosuke promises to deliver a unique experience, featuring over 150 yokai in a Japanese-style 2D pixel RPG. The game’s narrative revolves around a wooden doll containing the soul of a girl aspiring to become an onmyoji, traveling across Japan to seal monsters and forge friendships. Interestingly, the game was initially designed to incorporate GPS technology, a concept that predates the popular Pokémon Go by over a decade. However, due to developmental challenges, the GPS element was scrapped, leading to a reimagined gameplay experience that still captures the essence of exploration and adventure.

As we look forward to its release, fans are left wondering how this long-lost title will resonate with modern gamers. Will Navinosuke carve its own niche in the gaming landscape, or will it be overshadowed by its contemporaries? Only time will tell, but one thing is for sure: the journey of this game from obscurity to the spotlight is a testament to the enduring passion of its creators.
